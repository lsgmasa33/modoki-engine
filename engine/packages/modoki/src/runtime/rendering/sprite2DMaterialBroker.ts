 *  drive their uniforms, WITHOUT importing the heavy Scene2D module (which pulls in
 *  pixi.js) — keeping the driver's 3D path pixi-free.
 *
 *  Each live `Scene2DRenderer` registers its own `entityShaders` map here (GameView +
 *  SceneView run separate renderers over the same world, so an entity can have a Shader

 *  reads it (without consuming — both live renderers must see the same signal) to gate its
